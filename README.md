# Path-finder

Our project is a VR simulation of building and using paths from one point to another. We
created an experience of interactivity with different objects and obstacles for the user that
requires various levels of problem-solving to overcome. Our motivation was to make a game
that would allow the player to freely solve these puzzles and create their own paths to a goal.

We used the Unity engine to build our game and used free assets from the Unity Asset Store to
create our game world. The VR implementation was mainly done through Unityâ€™s XR Interaction
Toolkit which allows us to easily program and use a VR headset and VR controllers. Other
aspects were created from scratch like the terrain and several scripts.

The game has two levels that the player can traverse through and complete. Each with its own
unique puzzles and surroundings. Supplied with a variety of interactable objects, the player will
be able to problem-solve their way to the right flag goal. This game is playable mainly through
the Oculus Quest 2 but also features PS4 controller support and future plans for keyboard and
mouse support. The player will be able to place and rotate the objects so that they may make a
path through the terrain toward the goal.
